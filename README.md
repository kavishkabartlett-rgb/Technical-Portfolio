# 2025 Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science Portfolio 

## Overview 

My name is Kavishka Bartlett, and I am an undergraduate student at Duke University pursuing a double major in Electrical/Computer Engineering (ECE) and Computer Science (CS) with a minor in Mathmatics. 

This repository showcases projects that demonstrate my proficiency in C, MIPS Assembly, Java, and Logisim, focusing on low-level programming, hardware design, operating system logic, and multi-threaded parallel synchronization among others.* Each project includes a detailed README, which include the following sections: 

- **Overview:** Brief project description 
- **Detailed Overview/architecture:** System design, implementation details, and structure
- **Skills Used and Key Features:** Important technical concepts, methodologies, and tools used in the project
- **File Purposes:** Briefly explains the purpose of all files in file dense projects**
- **How to Run the Program:** Setup instructions
- **Input and Output data:** Required data from the user and the expected results
- **Next Steps:** Features to add that increase performance, runtime, and program ability

ALl code is extensively commented to ensure readability and optimal clarity. 

## Project Summary

- <big>**16-Bit CPU Circuit**</big> Built a fully functional 16-bit CPU with only basic logic structures (logic gates, mux, splitters) capable of executing MIPS Assembly programs 
- <big>**MIPS Assembly Language Programming: Recursion, Computations, and Dynamic Structures:**</big> Wrote 3 programs in MIPS Assembly implementing recursion, iterative, and memory management problem-solving techniques. Each program be run on the 16-bit CPU I built
- <big>**Parallel Synchronization in Multi-threaded Lab Simulation**</big> Worked with operating system logic using the pthread.h library in C. Used multiple mutexes and conditional variables to allow threads to run at the exact same time while ensuring accurate data
- <big>**Multi-Level Queue Dispatcher**</big> Implemented the logic of a multi-level queue dispatcher using C programming. Calculates performance metrics, directly prevents starvation, and uses both first come first served and round robin algorithms
- <big>**C Programming: Dynamic Data Handling and Recursive Computation**</big> Coded recursion, iterative and memory mangement methods in C. Worked with file parsing and direct data allocation
- <big>**Digital Logic Circuits: Finite State Machines, Adders, and Boolean Algebra**</big> Built Logisim circuits implementing boolean algebra, ripple carry adder/subtractor logic, and finite state moore machine. Used output equations, state transition tables, and D Flip-Flop registers to build the circuits

*Some of the projects were assigned by Duke University or University of Sydney. Whenever the instructors contributed frameworks, coding segments, or testing files to my projects, they were tagged as an author at the top of their respective file.  
**All files were included in some projects - the README files in those projects distinguish between algorithmic files (containing the actual problem-solving code) and other files (testing, GUI, etc.)
