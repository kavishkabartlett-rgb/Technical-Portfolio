# 2025 Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science Portfolio 

## Overview 

My name is Kavishka Bartlett, and I am an undergraduate student at Duke University pursuing a double major in Electrical/Computer Engineering (ECE) and Computer Science (CS) with a minor in Mathmatics. 

This repository showcases projects that demonstrate my proficiency in C, MIPS Assembly, Java, and Logisim, focusing on low-level programming, hardware design, operating system logic, and multi-threaded parallel synchronization among others.* Each project includes a detailed README, which include the following sections: 

- **Overview:** Brief project description 
- **Detailed Overview/architecture:** System design, implementation details, and structure
- **Skills Used and Key Features:** Important technical concepts, methodologies, and tools used in the project
- **File Purposes:** Briefly explains the purpose of all files in file dense projects. Algorithmic files are the most important files, and ordered by level of contribution, complexity and importance**
- **How to Run the Program:** Setup instructions
- **Input and Output data:** Required data from the user and the expected results
- **Next Steps:** Features to add that increase performance, runtime, and program ability

ALl code is extensively commented to ensure readability and optimal clarity. 

## Project Summary
*Projects are listed by decreasing order of complexity*

- <big>**Logisim Engineering: 16-Bit CPU Circuit**</big> Built a fully functional 16-bit CPU with only basic logic structures (logic gates, mux, splitters) capable of executing MIPS Assembly programs
- <big>**C Programming: Parallel Synchronization in Multi-threaded Lab Simulation**</big> Worked with operating system logic using the pthread.h library in C. Used multiple mutexes and conditional variables to allow threads to run at the exact same time while ensuring accurate data 
- <big>**MIPS Assembly Language Programming: Recursion, Computations, and Dynamic Structures:**</big> Wrote 3 programs in MIPS Assembly implementing recursion, iterative, and memory management problem-solving techniques. Each program be run on the 16-bit CPU I built
- <big>**C Programming: Multi-Level Queue Dispatcher**</big> Implemented the logic of a multi-level queue dispatcher using C programming. Calculates performance metrics, directly prevents starvation, and uses both first come first served and round robin algorithms
- <big>**Logisim Engineering: Digital Logic Circuits: Finite State Machines, Adders, and Boolean Algebra**</big> Built Logisim circuits implementing boolean algebra, ripple carry adder/subtractor logic, and finite state moore machine. Used output equations, state transition tables, and D Flip-Flop registers to build the circuits
- <big>**Java Programming: Word Completion Predictor**</big> Designed an autocomplete system to predict the word a user is attempting to type using binary search and HashMap algorithms. Wrote benchmark tests to compare efficiency
- <big>**C Programming: Dynamic Data Handling and Recursive Computation**</big> Coded recursion, iterative and memory mangement methods in C. Worked with file parsing and direct data allocation
- <big>**Java Programming: Markov Text Generator**</big> Developed and trained predictive text generator model using n-gram Markov chains. Implemented both a brute force and a more efficient HashMap algorithm. Used interfaces, class hierarchy, arraylists, file I/O, and Big O runtime calculations
- <big>**Java Programming: DNA Manipulation Simulator**</big> Simulated DNA manipulation with separate algorithms using Linked Lists, Strings, and StringBuilders. Had append, cut and slice, reverse, and nucleotideAt methods, as well as performance benchmarks to determine relationship between runtime efficiency and memory usage 
- <big>**Java Programming: US Map Route Planning Algorithm**</big> Simulate US road infrastructure with a graph structre (vertices, edges, edge weights), calculates the shortest route between two user-provided cities using Djikstra's algorithm, draws the route over US map, and outputs execution time and total route distance
- <big>**Java Programming: Huffman Encoding and Decoding**</big> Created a Huffman tree to encode and decode raw images and text. Used priority queues to ensure the highest occuring characters are represented with the shortest binary sequences 

*Some of the projects were assigned by Duke University or University of Sydney. Whenever the instructors contributed framework, coding segments, or testing files to my projects, they were tagged as an author at the top of their respective files.  
**All files were included in some projects - the README files in those projects distinguish between algorithmic files (ordered by importance) and other files (used for testing, GUI, etc.). If data files were used to test my programs, I included them in a separate Data folder
